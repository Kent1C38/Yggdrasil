# Yggdrasil

Yggdrasil is a **lightweight and flexible Minecraft server framework**, designed specifically for creating **custom minigame servers**.  

## Purpose

Yggdrasil is built to be **minimal by default**:  
- It provides a basic, functional engine without unnecessary features.  
- Customization is done entirely via **plugins**, thanks to the **provided API**, allowing developers to add functionality without modifying the core engine.

## Key Features

- **Lightweight and performant engine** – built on Minestom for fast and stable gameplay.  
- **Plugin API** – create independent modules that interact with the server engine.  
- **Fully customizable** – you control which features to enable or develop.  

## Upcoming Plugins

- A **permissions management plugin** is planned, but no release date has been set yet.

## Installation / Usage

Yggdrasil releases will include pre-compiled JAR files, so you can run the server without building it yourself.

1. Download the latest release JAR from the [releases page](https://github.com/Kent1C38/Yggdrasil/releases).  
2. Open a terminal in the folder containing the JAR.  
3. Run the server with:

```bash
java -jar Yggdrasil-<version>.jar
```
